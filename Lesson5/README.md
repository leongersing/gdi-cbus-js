README.md

use npm to install the dependencies.
``` npm install

start the server with node.
``` node server.js

browse to http://localhost:4020 to see the app. 

Tasks: 
  * Look at the console to see the data that is delivered by the server.
  * Display a list of the New Releases.
  * Filter the list of New Releases based on the criteria supplied in the text field.
  * Highlight the search terms found on the page.
  * Add a button to reset the input text box. When clicking it, remove all highlights, filters, and the text in the text field.

Requirements: 
  * You must declare at least 1 variable that was not provided for you.
  * You must write at least 1 function that was not provided for you.
  * You must ask for help when you're lost. Don't struggle here, there's plenty of time for that at home. :)
  * You must have fun!

NOTES: 
  * It does not have to work in every browser. Just yours.
  * Practice exploring the data in the console. Be creative!
  * While you can examine the node file (server.js) it's not indicative of a great server and should not be used in any production system.
